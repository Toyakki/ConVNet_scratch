# ConVNet_scratch
Exploring the modern Convnet architecture in the detection task. 

I am using the open sourced Moon crater dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lincolnzh/martianlunar-crater-detection-dataset

The architecture I am planning to explore is:
1. AutoEncoder
2. YOLO
3. EfficientNet
4. Faster-RCNN
5. DETR (DEtection TRansformer)

Except for YOLO, I am trying to make some of them from scratch for better understanding.
